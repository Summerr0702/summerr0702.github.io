I'm Summer Liu. My Chinese name is 柳从然, which literally means “a willow tree that grows freely, in tune with nature.” I imagine when my parents gave me this name, they were wishing for me to follow the quiet, honest rhythm of my own heart — to bend, not break, like a willow in the wind, and to live gently but freely, true to my nature.

At 19, I left the place I once called “home” and moved to a vibrant island at the southern edge of my motherland. I spent four long summers in Macau, a city of humidity, light, and memories that shimmer like heat on pavement. Now, I find myself in Canada, where winter seems to stretch over half the year, wondering what stories might unfold here. Through these journeys, “home” has been redefined, again and again. I guess I’m still figuring out where home really is. But I’ve come to love the feeling of being on the road.

I like traveling alone, watching films alone, attending live shows alone — but that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy the company of others.
I’ve simply built a quiet, safe corner for myself, a space to gather my travel journals, film reviews, and personal reflections. Writing helps me untangle my thoughts and see myself a little more clearly.
Perhaps the stories that happen to me hold no inherent meaning.
Perhaps even the act of writing them down feels futile at times.
But I write anyway, to give shape to the formless, and meaning to the moment.
Because, you know, the only way to fight nothingness is to create something :) 

P.S. I write in English sometimes, but more often in Chinese, the language that cradles my memories and slips more easily into silence.
