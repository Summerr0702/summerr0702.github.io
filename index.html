title: "I'm Summer, and this is my leafy corner."
excerpt: "Green is the color that speaks to my soul — peaceful, fresh, and quietly alive. <br>I wander through cities and seasons, capturing moments on film,
gathering curious trinkets that whisper stories of places and dreams. Here, I carve out a quiet nook for myself,<br> 
a place to hold my memories, tender and untouched by time."

overlay_text: |
  Born in the midsummer of the new millennium.  
  A willow tree takes root on my right arm,  
  bearing my surname passed down from my father.
