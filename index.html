title: "I'm Summer, and this is my secret haven."
excerpt: "Green is the color that speaks to my soul—peace, fresh, and quietly alive. I wander through cities and seasons, capturing moments on film,
gathering curious trinkets that whisper stories of places and dreams. Here, I carve out a quiet corner for myself— a place to hold my memories, tender and untouched by time."

  Born in the midsummer of the new millennium.  
  A willow tree takes root on my right arm,  
  bearing my surname passed down from my father.
