 去年在日本的14天，是我第一次独自一人出国旅行。让我下定决心出行的原因其实在我之前的很多篇微博里就已经说明了，尽管现在写出来还是感觉那么中二——因为SD大电影的上映，太多人开始讨论起这部作品，在最初的兴奋过后，我感到被打扰。我以为SD是我借井上之笔为自己筑起的小巢，我可以在其中自在安静地待一辈子，那些年轻的男孩女孩将注视着我成长，直到有一天我不再需要借助他们的力量。

 然而大电影的上映召唤了一出出热闹（甚至略显荒诞）的狂欢闹剧。我很快接受了SD到底是一部影响之深且经久不衰的作品，在各个年代、各种观众间展现它无与伦比的魅力。这是一部伟大的作品，人人都爱它，人人都爱那些男孩女孩。每个人都在宣泄着自己的表达，太多的声音涌入我的头脑，我的爱突然变得极为渺小。在那些听起来笃定的描述里我开始感到疑惑，后来又觉得愤怒（因为乐子人和cp脑人的入侵），但很快这些情绪转化为对自我的怀疑：我又真的了解他们吗，我又怎么会知道他们是什么样的人呢？这种怀疑的本质是对自己的存在的怀疑，当每个人都在参与同一件事并对其发出各种声音，我在其中的位置在哪里，我有多重要？或者说，我重要吗？

 井上雄彦在《空白》里写，“人类脑子里想的事情，终究是有限度的”，所以他说人要靠身体去理解事物，“只要彻底明白一个人的身体，充分理解被赋予的事物该如何操作，就能找到所有人类的答案”。他在画《浪客行》期间去了西班牙追寻高第的痕迹，他问自己，“有什么是我不来巴塞罗那就无法找到答案的呢？我要的答案，是什么问题的答案呢？”

 我意识到这其实是我当下的迷茫。我的疑问如此巨大但问题又是如此模糊，一团郁结凝在我心头，而我不知其来源。“话说只有来到巴塞罗那、亲自触摸到高第的作品才能感受到的东西，这种带有条件的问题，我是找不出答案的。因为大师位在任何地方，任何人都能够回答我。在巴塞罗那所体会到的，正适合把我摇醒。或许。只是为了让我重新找到自己已经握在手上的答案，让我偶尔闭上、什么都看不见的眼睛重新睁开，所以需要这样摇一摇。”

 于是我也这样独自一人上路了。

 时隔近一年，我敲着键盘想要复盘下去年的旅行，希望以此拾起那些珍贵的回忆和感受，尽管它们早已附着在我的身体里，成为我的一部分，但我总归想留下些什么具体的东西。这趟旅程的最后，我是否找到了我想要的答案呢？现在回头想想，我认为答案是，“是的，我更加摸清了自己的形状”。我的答案，连同我的困惑，说到底都是很抽象的、无法被表达的，也许这正应证着井上所说的，要靠身体去感受。所以记录过程要比记录结论更为重要，这也是我想写下这些游记的动机。

 P.S. 我给这趟旅行起名叫黑兜里遛狗，是ひとりりょこう的谐音（...）记得大三的时候跟Kelly和Tracy学起我日文堂口语小测的表现，她们笑我说旅行就像在说遛狗，因此去年在ig发文就是用起了这个自创的我以为很可爱的hashtag。其实去年这趟日本行也是我送给自己的毕业旅行来着，于是我用这个名称纪念起大学时期最要好的这一段友谊。

If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.

I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.

Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.

Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.

Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.
