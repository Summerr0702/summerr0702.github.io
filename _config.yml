# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Born in the golden summer of the new millennium. 
  A willow tree takes root on my right arm — bearing my surname passed down from my father.
  And mother named me 从然, hoping I would live by the quiet wisdom of my nature. Therefore I left the land I once called home. 
  They began to call me Summer, for the season I was born in — and because my true name felt too distant on their tongues.
  But history lives in me still, and so I began to write, to remember and to become who I truely am.
